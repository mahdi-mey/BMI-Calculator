# BMI Calculator

This is a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator project that allows users to calculate their BMI based on their weight and height inputs. The project features the following:

## Features

1. **Weight and Height Inputs**: The BMI calculator provides two input fields where users can enter their weight and height values. These inputs allow for easy data entry and adjustment.

2. **User-Friendly UI**: The user interface of the BMI calculator is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. It provides clear instructions on how to use the calculator and offers a visually pleasing layout.

3. **BMI Classification**: Upon calculating the BMI, the project displays an H1 tag that indicates the user's weight status using color-coded labels. The H1 tag varies its color to provide quick visual feedback to the user, with the following color scheme:

   - **Orange**: Indicates "Underweight" status.
   - **Green**: Represents "Normal Weight" status.
   - **Red**: Signifies "Overweight" status.

   This feature helps users quickly identify their weight category based on their calculated BMI.
